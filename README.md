# Instagram-clone
<h3>Instagram is clone work.</h3>


Instagram is clone work. Current side panel is used. It is a work prepared as homework. The navbar used at the top in the old examples is taken to the side. Since I use the background in dark mode on my personal computer, I preferred to use a dark design in my work. I think the fact that it was dark next to all the white background works made a difference. If the file does not work properly, it is recommended to open it with a live server.
